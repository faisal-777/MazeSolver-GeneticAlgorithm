# MazeSolver-GeneticAlgorithm
Explore a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for solving mazes efficiently. This repository contains code to generate random mazes, evolve a population of agents to find the optimal path through the maze, and visualize the results. Challenge yourself to create the most efficient maze-solving agent using genetic algorithms!
